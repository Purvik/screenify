# screenify

Welcome to Screenify. The basic aim of this app is to provide designs of different common screens on app and to provide code for those screens here in the github repo. 

## Types of basic screens...

There are basically 5 types of screens.

1) HomeScreens
2) LoginScreens
3) AppDrawers
4) BottomSheets
5) ProfileScreens

**Although _App Drawers_ and _BottomSheets_ are not considered as different screens in general paradigms, I have considered them as screen as they can be made as creative as possible from the design point of view.**

## How to contribute in this repo...

One can contribute to this repo by following means..

1) Providing the code written by the contributor of a design found on dribble or any other design providing platform. * (**If one is replicating the design from the dribble it is the best practice to take the permission of the owner of the design before implementing it and contributing it here**)

2) Creating a clone of one of the above-mentioned screens of an existing app in flutter and then contributing.

## What steps are needed in order to make a successful Pull request...

### Step 1)

Convert the desingn into a flutter code... following the best practices of writing a flutter code will increase the chances of getting the pull request merged quickly.

### Step 2)

Take the screenshot of the design that you have created and put in inside the `assets/images/"type_of_screen"/"your_design_name"` directory along with other assets(if any).

## Step 3)

Make the pull request. If all goes good and the code for design follows the best practices, the request will be merged within 48 hours.




## Conclusion
Looking forward for all the good PRs and amazing designs from your side. Lets make this app as rich as possible in terms of designs and help other flutter developers to save time in creating similar designs from scratch.
